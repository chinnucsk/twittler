%% Just because Twitter offers 3 different types of filters via post
%% and 2 other public streams (sample, firehose) via get, plus user
%% and site streams via get doesn't mean I need to make my API quite
%% that convoluted

Capture list of streams:
* Site streams require permission. Leave alone for now.
* User streams are fairly complex but should be doable
* Sample stream gives random tweets
* Firehose stream gives all tweets, restricted. If sample works, firehose should too(?)
* Filter/follow - like following a set of users
* Filter/track - keyword search
* Filter/locations


stream(track, []) (optional 3rd argument)
stream(follow, [])
stream(locations, [])
stream(user) (optional 2nd argument)
stream(sample) (optional 2nd argument)
stream(firehose) (optional 2nd argument)

## Need to watch for extra streaming messages (these are mandatory)
  * Blank lines (keep-alive)
  * Tweet deletion notices (sigh)
  * Location deletion notices
  * Limit notices
  * Withheld notices
  * Disconnect messages

For user streams
  * Friends list
  * Events (blocks, favorites)

For site streams (disregard for now)...


May want to grab blocked users GET blocks/ids
