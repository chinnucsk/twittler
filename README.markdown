Erlang Twitter API library.

This is still very primitive (needs OTP, many functionality gaps
remain, zero documentation) but is usable today.

It originated with Nick Gerakines
(https://github.com/ngerakines/erlang_twitter) and my intent was to
patch his library, but with mandatory OAuth (and my unwillingness to
spend lots of time managing records to represent Twitter objects) it
was necessary to effectively replace all of the Erlang.  All that
remains: `Makefile` and `include.mk`.
